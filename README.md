## ⚠️ The Problem: A Hidden Security Risk  

Every day, people print sensitive documents like resumes, legal papers, or financial statements at local print shops.  
The standard process is risky:  

- **Emailing**: You email the document to the shop, leaving a copy in your sent folder and on their computer.  
- **USB Drives**: You use a personal USB drive on a public computer, risking malware infections.  
- **Local Copies**: In both cases, a copy of your sensitive document is downloaded and saved onto the print shop's computer, where it can be forgotten, accessed by others, or potentially stolen.  

This creates a significant **digital footprint** for your most private information.

## ✨ Our Solution: A Zero-Trust Printing Workflow  

SecurePrint completely redesigns this workflow with **privacy at its core**.  
It creates a secure, temporary bridge between you and the printer, ensuring your document is **never downloaded or permanently stored** on the print shop's system.  

✅ Users upload documents to their private dashboard.  
✅ Generate a **temporary, shareable link** protected by a **One-Time Password (OTP)**.  
✅ Print shop owners access a **short-lived print session** where they can print documents directly **without saving them**.
