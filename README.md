🛡️ SecurePrint - Privacy-First Document Printing
A full-stack MERN application designed to eliminate the security risks of printing documents at public print shops.

</div>

The Problem: A Hidden Security Risk ⚠️
Every day, people print sensitive documents like resumes, legal papers, or financial statements at local print shops. The standard process is risky:

Emailing: You email the document to the shop, leaving a copy in your sent folder and on their computer.

USB Drives: You use a personal USB drive on a public computer, risking malware infections.

Local Copies: In both cases, a copy of your sensitive document is downloaded and saved onto the print shop's computer, where it can be forgotten, accessed by others, or potentially stolen.

This creates a significant digital footprint for your most private information.

Our Solution: A Zero-Trust Printing Workflow ✨
SecurePrint completely redesigns this workflow with privacy at its core. It creates a secure, temporary bridge between you and the printer, ensuring your document is never downloaded or permanently stored on the print shop's system.

The application allows users to upload documents to their private, secure dashboard. When they need to print, they generate a temporary, shareable link protected by a One-Time Password (OTP) sent to their email. The print shop owner uses this link to access a short-lived print session where they can print documents directly without ever saving them.

核心功能 (Core Features)
🔐 Secure Authentication: Full user registration and login system with JWT-based authentication.

🗂️ Private Document Management: Users can upload, view, and delete their documents from a personal dashboard.

🔗 URL Shortener: Generates short, easy-to-share links for print sessions.

🔑 OTP Verification: Print sessions are protected by a time-sensitive One-Time Password sent to the user's email.

🚫 Download-Free Printing: The core feature! Documents are streamed directly to the browser's print function from memory, never saving a file to the print shop's computer.

💧 Dynamic Watermarking: Documents in the print preview are watermarked to deter screenshots, but the watermark is automatically removed from the final printed page.

🔍 Live Search: Fast, client-side filtering on both the user dashboard and the print session page.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture
This project is a classic MERN stack application, with a clear separation between the frontend client and the backend server.



Technology

Description

Frontend

React.js

A declarative UI library for building the user interface.



React Router

For client-side routing and navigation.



Tailwind CSS

A utility-first CSS framework for rapid, modern styling.



Axios

For making promise-based HTTP requests to the backend API.

Backend

Node.js

A JavaScript runtime for building the server-side application.



Express.js

A minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js.



MongoDB

A NoSQL database used to store user data, document metadata, and session info.



Mongoose

An ODM library for MongoDB to manage relationships between data.

Authentication

JWT & bcryptjs

For creating secure tokens and hashing user passwords.

Services

Nodemailer

For sending transactional emails (e.g., OTPs).

🚀 Getting Started: Local Development Setup
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v14 or later)

npm

MongoDB (local instance or a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)

1. Clone the Repository
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/secure-print-app.git](https://github.com/your-username/secure-print-app.git)
cd secure-print-app

2. Install Backend Dependencies
cd backend
npm install

3. Install Frontend Dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install

4. Set Up Environment Variables
This is a crucial step. You need to create a .env file in the /backend directory.

Navigate to the backend folder.

Create a file named .env.

Copy the contents of .env.example (or the block below) into it and fill in your own values.

# /backend/.env

# MongoDB Connection String
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

# JWT Secret Key (generate a long, random string)
JWT_SECRET=your_super_strong_jwt_secret

# Port for the server
PORT=5000

# Nodemailer credentials for sending OTPs (use Gmail with an App Password)
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_gmail_app_password

# Frontend URL (for the URL shortener)
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

5. Run the Application
You will need two separate terminals open.

In Terminal 1 (for the Backend):

cd backend
npm start 
# Or 'npm run dev' for nodemon

In Terminal 2 (for the Frontend):

cd frontend
npm start

The frontend should now be running on http://localhost:3000 and the backend on http://localhost:5000.

🔮 Future Scope
[ ] QR Code Sharing: Allow users to generate a QR code for the print link to be scanned by the print shop owner.

[ ] Folder Organization: Implement a folder system for better document management.

[ ] Drag-and-Drop Uploads: Enhance the UX with a modern drag-and-drop file upload interface.

[ ] Manual Session Revocation: Give users a button to manually expire a print link before its natural timeout.
